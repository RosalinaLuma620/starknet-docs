Starknet is a permissionless, decentralized validity rollup, also known as a zero-knowledge rollup (ZK rollup). It is a blockchain that operates as a Layer 2 (L2) network over Ethereum, enabling any dApp to achieve unlimited scale for its computation - without
compromising Ethereum’s composability and security - thanks to Starknet’s reliance on the safest and most scalable cryptographic proof system: STARK.

Starknet contracts and the Starknet OS are written in Cairo – supporting the deployment and scaling of any use case, whatever the business logic.

Cairo is Starknet's native programming language. It is a Turing-complete language that enables blockchain developers to harness the power of STARKs.

Cairo is Rust-inspired, allowing developers to write Starknet smart contracts in a safe and convenient manner.
